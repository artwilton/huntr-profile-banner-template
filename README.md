# Huntr - Profile Banner Template
While trying to upload a profile banner image on huntr.co I ran into a few issues with the image being resized, and wanted to share a template that worked well for me as of 07/27/2022.

The template image files are located in this repo in the `template_files` directory, with several different options.

The most basic option is to use the [huntr_banner_template_flat.png](template_files/huntr_banner_template_flat.png) image. This can be used as a background reference in any image editing software or websites like Canva and Figma.

For more advanced options, there is also a layered .psd for use in Adobe Photshop named [huntr_banner_template_layered.psd](/template_files/huntr_banner_template_layered.psd), and a png file with just the visible area overlayed on a transparent background named [huntr_banner_template_overlay_only.png](/template_files/huntr_banner_template_overlay_only.png)
